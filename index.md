About me: Currently, I am a physics major at the University of Connect on track to graduate in May 2026. I was born in New York then moved to Greenwich Connecticut where I attended Highschool. I began my college career as a Mechanical Engineer at Fairfield University where I also played D1 rugby. I quickley realized I prefere the theory and thinking style of Physics to my current major, so I made the switch during my second semester. After my freshman year concluded I transferred to the University of Connecticut where I continued my education untill this point.
